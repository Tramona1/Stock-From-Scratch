# Stock Analytics Dashboard: Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Stock Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive financial data platform that provides users with personalized stock market insights and analysis. The system integrates real-time financial data from various sources, presents it through an intuitive user interface, and enhances it with AI-powered analysis capabilities.

## Key Components and Achievements

### 1. Data Integration System

We've successfully built a robust data pipeline that:

- **Collects financial data** from multiple external APIs including Unusual Whales
- **Processes and normalizes** raw data into consistent formats
- **Stores data** in a structured Supabase database with appropriate indexing
- **Updates automatically** through a scheduled Python backend service
- **Optimizes API usage** by focusing on watchlist stocks

### 2. Frontend Interface

The user interface provides a seamless experience with:

- **Responsive dashboard** built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- **Data visualization** for various financial metrics and indicators
- **Personalized watchlist** for tracking specific stocks
- **Customizable views** for different types of financial data
- **Proper loading, empty, and error states** throughout the application

### 3. AI Query System

We've implemented an advanced AI query system that:

- **Understands natural language questions** about financial data
